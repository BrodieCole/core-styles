Webstop Style Guide
===================


## Setup

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Ruby 2
- RVM
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)

Once you've gotten the prerequisites met issue the following command:

$`bundle install`



## Bootstrap Docs


Note we don't include `getting-started/introduction` page, because this page does not apply to our environment and gives conflicting instructions.


## TODOS


- Update page navigation to use `path` in addition to `title` so we can group pages we create with Boostrap pages, for example under the layout section.
