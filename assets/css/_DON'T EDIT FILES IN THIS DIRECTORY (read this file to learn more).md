# Don't Edit Files in This Directory

The CSS files found here are generated by a SCSS files found in the SCSS folder 
in the root directory.

For example, if you edit the file:

`/SCSS/docs/core-style-guide.scss` 

The watch script will notice when changes are made to that file and 
generate the following file:

`/assets/css/docs/core-style-guide.css`.

To run the watch script, open a terminal window and type `./watch`.
