Webstop Style Guide
===================

TODOS:
------

- [ ] make it so Sass compiles a css version of the core-styles.scss file in the css folder.
- [ ] move dev site sass files out of the css folder and into the _sass folder
- [ ] eleminate the wsg folder and files (they should probably be in the _sass/docs folder)
