## Goals

The primary goal is to improve the capabilities of Webstop's 
front-end design system to enable our developers to write more 
flexible, reliable, and consistent front-end code.

The second goal is to build a design system that is back-end 
agnostic, and easily portable to diverse environments. This 
allows modern environments based on technologies like 
Ruby on Rails, and Ember.js, and even legacy environments like 
Lasso, to share a common set of front-end components. It 
enables us to have a consistent styling and behavior across all 
our diverse environments. 

We have incorporated may of the industries latest best practices 
and applied them to our environment.
